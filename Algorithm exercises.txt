1)Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given number n.

Start
Get input n from the user
Initialize variable sum = 0
Use a loop from 1 to n:
Add each number to sum
Display the final sum
End

2)Check for Prime Number Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is a prime number or not.

Start
Get input n from the user
If n ≤ 1, print "Not Prime" and stop
Loop from 2 to √n:
If n is divisible by any number in this range, print "Not Prime" and stop
If no divisors are found, print "Prime Number"
End

3)Find the Maximum of Three Numbers Write an algorithm that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest of them.
Start
2️Get a list of numbers from the user.
Convert the input into a list of integers.
Sort the list in descending order (largest to smallest).
Select the first three numbers from the sorted list.
Print the top three maximum numbers.
End

Else we can use MAX to find a answer

4)Factorial Calculation Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n.

Start
Get input n from the user
If n = 0 or n = 1, return 1 (since 0! = 1! = 1)
Initialize factorial = 1
Loop from 1 to n:
Multiply factorial by the current number
Print the factorial
End

5) Check if a Number is Even or Odd Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd.

Start
Get input n from the user
If n % 2 == 0, print "Even"
Else, print "Odd"
End
